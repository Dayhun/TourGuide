                                After the armistice of the Korean War, it was
                                divided into South and North Korea. The Korean
                                War officially leads to a "cease of war," not an
                                "end of war," but it is actually an end of war
                                because there has been no battle for over 70
                                years.
                            </p>

                                As you can see on the map, Republic of Korea is
                                located south of the ceasefire line. The capital
                                city is Seoul. Korea has three sides of the sea.
                                There's a lot of beaches. For people who like
                                nature more than the city, there's places where
                                you can see the ocean, not Seoul but Busan and
                                Jeju Island. We also recommend going to the
                                area!

                                    stores are written in Korean. It may be hard
                                    to find English on the street! Also, there
                                    are many buildings built with hanok, a
                                    traditional Korean building. There are many
                                    shops that rent hanbok, traditional Korean
                                    clothes, so walking around Anguk with hanbok
                                    will feel like walking through Korean

                                    distributed at Hangang Park, you often get a

                        <p>
                            It is an island located in the southern sea of Korea
                            and the largest island in Korea, and is a volcanic
                            island formed by volcanic activities. For this
                            reason, Hallasan Mountain is in the center and there
                            are 370 parasitic volcanoes throughout the island,
                            making it a popular place for many hikers. Since it
                            is a volcanic island, there are many basalt, so you
                            can see many fences made of basalt. DolHarubang, a
                            stone statue handed down from Jeju Island and a
                            symbol of Jeju Island, is made of basalt and has a
                            wide hole, which also shows a rough and affectionate
                            appearance. Dolharubang is Jeju language, meaning
                            "old man stone" when interpreted in standard
                            language. Jeju Island is also nicknamed Tangerine
                            island because it has a lot of tangerines. It is
                            famous as a place where you see dolphins. In
                            addition, Jeju Island belongs to a temperate
                            climate, and even in winter, it rarely falls below
                            zero. Also it's windy, so there are many people to
                            do surfing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Let me introduce a famous island in Jeju. Udo Island
                            is an island in Jeju Island. The name Udo was given
                            because the island looked like a cow lying down. You
                            have to go in by boat for about 15 minutes. Udo
                            Island, like Jeju Island, has the unique topography
                            of the lava zone and beautiful natural scenery.
                            Because the island is small, you can rent a bicycle
                            or scooter to see the entire island in plenty. You
                            can see Udo Island in full bloom in spring, and on
                            summer nights, you can see the beautiful night view
                            of the fishing boats off Udo Island and the sea. Udo
                            Island is famous for peanuts. Udo peanuts are mostly
                            known, and wherever you go, you can see the unusual
                            scene of selling peanut ice cream, and they also
                            sell makgeolli (traditional Korean liquor) with
                            peanuts.

                            Hyeopjae Beach, which is famous for its beauty,
                            shows the color of the sea as if emerald paint was
                            slowly dissolved in transparent water. At low tide,
                            the silver sand beach with a lot of shells continues
                            endlessly. In front of the sea, there is a
                            "Biyangdo" in the shape of an elephant picture that
                            swallowed a boa snake in the little prince. Biyangdo
                            Island and the sunset falling over the sea are
                            another spectacular sight to be missed here. In
                            summer, there is also a night opening, so you can
                            enjoy the blue night of Jeju Island under the palm
                            tree. Hyeopjae Beach has a gentle slope, so the
                            depth is shallow, and there is a pine forest, so it
                            is good as a vacation destination for family
                            travelers with children. There are various cafes,
                            restaurants, and accommodations around, so it is the
                            best beach for sightseeing.

                                    It is a type of traditional Korean liquor
                                    made of rice. There are many people who say
                                    that it has a subtle, savory, slightly sweet
                                    taste, and a slightly tangy feeling, and
                                    tastes like sour soda. Since makgeolli has a
                                    4-6% alcohol content and does not taste
                                    bitter, it is important to drink slowly and
                                    leisurely because it is easy to drink too
                                    much. On a rainy day, try makgeolli with
                                    korean style pancake.
